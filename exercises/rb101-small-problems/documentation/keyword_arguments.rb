# what does the code print?
5.step(to: 10, by: 3) { |value| puts value }
# SOLUTION
# 5
# 8
# .step method takes the starting position, the calling object in this case 5
# and steps up in intervals specified by the arguments passed in "by"
# the argument passed in "to" tells it to stop before getting to that number
