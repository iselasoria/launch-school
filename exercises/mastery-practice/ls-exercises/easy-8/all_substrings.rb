=begin 
* DONE 55s
Write a method that returns a list of all substrings of a string. The returned list should be ordered by where in the string the substring begins. This means that all substrings that start at position 0 should come first, then all substrings that start at position 1, and so on. Since multiple substrings will occur at each position, the substrings at a given position should be returned in order from shortest to longest.

You may (and should) use the leading_substrings method you wrote in the previous exercise:
=end 

def substrings(str)
  subs = []
  (0...str.size).each do |starting|
    (starting...str.size).each do |ending|

    subs << str[starting..ending]
    end
  end
  subs
end

# test cases 
p substrings('abcde') == [
  'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'abcd', 'abcde',
  'b', 'bc', 'bcd', 'bcde',
  'c', 'cd', 'cde',
  'd', 'de',
  'e'
]
