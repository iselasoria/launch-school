The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting with 1 and 1 where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers: the 3rd Fibonacci number is 1 + 1 = 2, the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. In mathematical terms:


F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where n > 2
Sequences like this translate naturally as "recursive" methods. A recursive method is one in which the method calls itself. For example:


def sum(n)
  return 1 if n == 1
  n + sum(n - 1)
end

sum is a recursive method that computes the sum of all integers between 1 and n.

Recursive methods have three primary qualities:

They call themselves at least once.
They have a condition that stops the recursion (n == 1 above).
They use the result returned by themselves.
In the code above, sum calls itself once; it uses a condition of n == 1 to stop recursing; and, n + sum(n - 1) uses the return value of the recursive call to compute a new return value.

Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument to the method.
