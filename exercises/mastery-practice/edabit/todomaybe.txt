=begin 
Write a function that returns true if the first string is the second string stretched, and false otherwise. A stretch is to repeat each character in a string the same number of times.
Examples

is_stretched("pppaaannndddaaa", "panda") ➞ true

is_stretched("sssshhiipp", "ship") ➞ false

is_stretched("magnet", "magnet") ➞ true

is_stretched("magneto", "magnet") ➞ false

Notes

    Both strings must contain the same letters in order for the stretch to be valid.
    All strings will be in lower case letters.


=========================================

Write a function that selects all words that have all the same vowels (in any order and/or number) as the first word, including the first word.
Examples

same_vowel_group(["toe", "ocelot", "maniac"]) ➞ ["toe", "ocelot"]

same_vowel_group(["many", "carriage", "emit", "apricot", "animal"]) ➞ ["many"]

same_vowel_group(["hoops", "chuff", "bot", "bottom"]) ➞ ["hoops", "bot", "bottom"]

Notes

    Words will contain only lowercase letters, and may contain whitespaces.
    Frequency does not matter (e.g. if the first word is "loopy", then you can include words with any number of o's, so long as they only contain o's, and not any other vowels).
