The meaning of an expression is determined by the presendence of the operators used. 
When the operation has two operands, each with the same presedence then the expression
gets evaluated from left-to-right, _Note:_ In such cases it can lead to unexpected
results when using the `||` and `&&` or ternary operator `a ? b : c`
