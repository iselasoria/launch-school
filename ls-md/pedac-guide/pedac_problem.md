# The PEDAC Process

## P: Understanding the Problem

- Establish the rules/define the boundaries of the problem
  - Assess available information
  - Restate explicit requirements
  - Identify implicit requirements
- Spend enough time here, don't rush this step!

**General Example**
Give a string, produce a snew string with every other word removed.

- Explicit requirements:
- input: string
- output: new string
- remove every other word from the input string


(These define the implcit requirements of the problem)
- Questions:
  - what do we mean by every other word?
  - how do we define a word in this context?
    - words are delimited by spaces
