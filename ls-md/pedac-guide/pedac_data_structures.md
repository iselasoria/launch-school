## Data Sctructures

- Help to reason with data more logically
- Help us to interat with data at an implementation level
- Thinking in terms of data structure is part of the problem solving process
- Data structures are closely linked to algorithms
  - Set of steps from input to output
    - involves structuring data a certain way

```

      2
    4  6
  8 10  12
14  16  18  20
```

- Overal structure represeting a sequence as a whole
- Individual rows within overall structure 
- Individual rows in a set order in context of sequence
- Individual rows contain integers
- Can assume the integers are in a set order in the context of the sequence

  [2],
  [4, 6],
  [8, 10, 12],
  [14,16,18,20]
