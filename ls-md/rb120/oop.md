The main difference between [[object]] oriented programming and [[procedural programming]] is how each paradigm views the world.
OOP views the world as a collection of objects that have the ability to interact with each other sporadically. For example one day waking up and having a shower, brushing your teeth and going to work, and the next waking up, brushing your teeth, working out and then going to work. The order is less predictable but seemingly closer to real life. 

In OOP, we design with the knowledge that we won't have control over the order of interactions between objects. This is why it is important to build code with fewer [[dependencies]]. 

OOP is a paradigm where we design with the intention of making an application transparent, resilient and scalable. An ideal OOP-style application should have single-focus classes (with single-focus methods) and a simple new request to modify should equal a simple change.
