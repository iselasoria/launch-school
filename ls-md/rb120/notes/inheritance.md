Ruby implements single- [[inheritance]]. This means that behaviors are passed down from a [[superclass]] to a [[subclass]].


|   INHERITANCE TYPE      |   RELATIONSHIP TYPE  |    EXAMPLE        |    
| :----------------------:|:--------------------- |:-----------------------:|
| class inheritance       | _has-a_ relationship    | A dog _is a_ mammal.|
| module mixins           |  _is-a_ relationship    | A dog has an ability to swim.
