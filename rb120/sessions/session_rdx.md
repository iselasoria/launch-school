# The difference between the two snippets is that in the first one, the id attribute is defined as a private method using attr_reader, while in the second one it is defined as a protected method.

# In Ruby, private methods can only be called within the context of the current object. This means that in the first snippet, when the == method tries to call other_student.id, it raises a NoMethodError because id is a private method and cannot be called on another instance of the Student class.

# On the other hand, protected methods can be called by any instance of the defining class or its subclasses. This means that in the second snippet, when the == method calls other_student.id, it works because id is now a protected method and can be called on another instance of the Student class.

# So, in summary, the first snippet doesnâ€™t work because it tries to call a private method on another instance of the class, while the second snippet works because it calls a protected method on another instance of the class.
