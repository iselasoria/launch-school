## Equality Methods

## Comparison Methods

## The `<<` and `>>` Shift Methods
They make the most sense when working with classes that represent a collection 

## The Plus Method 
The functionality here is always incrementing or concatenation. 
The `.+` method is accessible to all kinds of objects, such as `String#+`, `Integer#+`, `Array#+` etc, each one returning an objects of the class that called it. `String#+` returns a String object, for example. We should keep this pattern in mind:

> return an objects of the class that called the `plus` operator.
