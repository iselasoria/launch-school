=begin 
1. Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, allow the user to 
define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model of the car. Create an instance variable 
that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car as well. 
Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.
