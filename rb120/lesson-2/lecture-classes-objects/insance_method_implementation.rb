=begin 
Modify the class definition from above to facilitate the following methods. Note that there is no name= setter method now.

bob = Person.new('Robert')
bob.name                  # => 'Robert'
bob.first_name            # => 'Robert'
bob.last_name             # => ''
bob.last_name = 'Smith'
bob.name                  # => 'Robert Smith'



Hint: let first_name and last_name be "states" and create an instance method called name that uses those states.

    parts = full_name.split
    @first_name = parts.first 
    @last_name = parts.size > 1 ? parts.last : ""

  def name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}".strip
