# What is Object Oriented Programming, and why was it created?
# What are the benefits of OOP, and examples of problems it solves?

# OOP is a programming paradigm that was created to deal with the increasing complexity of larger codebases, and shift away from the procedural programming paradigm.

# A procedural program is a sequence of events that is executed in a particular order. Every step depends on the previous step executing. As a result, one small change can create a ripple effect throughout the entire program.

# OOP encapsulates data within containers that can be changed in isolation without affected the entire program. The program then becomes an interaction of many inidivual pieces instead of a singular dependent program.

# OOP makes codebases more maintainable and easier to work with. This new approach to programming allows for polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance and encapsulation.

# procedural Programming
  # order
  # series/sequence of events

  # EX:
  # wake up
  # brush teeth
  # shower
  # got to work

# object oriented programming
  # possibilities
  # collection of objects that interact with eachother

  # EX:
  # wake up
  # shower
  # brush teeth
  # flat tire, must fix
  # go to work (late)
