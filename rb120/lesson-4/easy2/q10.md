What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? 
Think of as many as you can.

1. Reusable code 
2. Concise, non-repetitive code 
3. Easy to maintain, complex code becomes easier to manage
4. Changes take effect for all involved parts not just where the change took place
5. More abstract than procedural programming
6. Objects represented by nouns and easier to conceptualize 
7. Allows for controlled exposure of certain parts of the code
